### Bug Reports
Here, you will see detailed reports of bugs I found when testing an online pet shop. Each bug report includes a problem description, steps to reproduce, expected and actual results, and screenshots.


## Checklists

This part has lists I made to check different parts of software testing. These lists help make sure the software is good. You will find lists like:


- Online Store Checklist: Covers all important functions and interface elements of the online store, including navigation, product search, adding products to the cart, the ordering process, and filtering and sorting products.
